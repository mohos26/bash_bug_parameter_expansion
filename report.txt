Problem description:
When using parameter expansion with a variable containing a space, and then
concatenating it with a string followed by $, an extra leading space appears
before the text.

Steps to reproduce:

export S=" "
echo $S"hello"$

Actual output:
 hello$

Expected output:
hello$

Environment:
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 (Linux 5.15)
Locale: en_US.UTF-8

This behavior does not seem documented in POSIX or in the Bash source code.
Please investigate and correct the parameter-expansion behavior so it matches the expected output.
